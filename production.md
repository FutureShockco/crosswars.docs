# Production

Every player can produce two categories of things in the game: RESOURCES and UNITS. Resources are produced by buildings and used to upgrade those buildings or to produce (recruit and train) units for battles. Both resources and units can be produced in a time managed way or instantly if a player decides to pay with cryptocurrency for faster production.
