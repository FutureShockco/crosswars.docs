# Resources

There are 3 types of resources in the game, drugs, weapons, and alcohol. Each resource is produced by its corresponding buildings. Each building has different amounts of resources needed for its production that rise with each level. When a player starts playing a game, he or she already has a small amount of each resource to start with. A player CAN NOT have infinite amounts of resources. The amounts of maximum resources are defined with storage buildings for every resource. The maximum level of any building is defined with the current level of headquarters. A building can not be upgraded to a level higher than the headquarters are currently. If headquarters are, for example, on level 5, all other buildings can go to level 5 and no higher until the HQ gets upgraded.

TIP: While there are many ways to approach strategy in CrossWars, a good starting point is a ratio of 1:2:2, meaning 1 DRUG to 2 WEAPON to 2 ALCOHOL. So if you are producing 100k drugs, you want to be around 200k each of both weapons and alcohol.

## Cash

Cash are the most important resource in the CrossWars game. Players receive their daily prize based on the amount of drugs they produce but they can get drugs by either producing or by stealing them from other players in battles. To ensure that their drugs do not get stolen, players can upgrade their Drug Storage building and keep a portion of their drug resource unavailable to steal. Each building has the following information: level of the building that is over the image, name, cost for the next upgrade in resource under the name and in crypto for instant upgrade, description, and the amount of production on current and next level per day. Each building associated with drugs requires all 3 resources for upgrades; drugs, weapons, and alcohol.

### Crack House

![](/img/help/image134.jpg)

Crack House is the basic drug production building that is very cheap to upgrade but also produces the least drugs in comparison with other buildings. This building is a good thing to start with when you are first starting to play the game so your production increases in time and you can afford to upgrade more useful ones. In the picture above is the example of how on current level 18 a player produces 7.34 thousand drugs every day with this building while he will produce 7.81 thousand drugs on level 19\. Since the resources are in white, it indicates he has enough of them. If he clicks on the “upgrade” button he would have to wait for 41 minutes and 28 seconds for the upgrade to finish and for the building to rise in level.

### Hydroponic Farm

![](/img/help/image84.jpg)

This building is next in line when it comes to producing drugs. It is still in the category of fairly cheap buildings when it comes to producing drugs. In the picture above is the example of how on current level 6 a player produces 8.24 thousand drugs per day with this building while he would produce 9.71 thousand on level 7\. Since the resources are in white, it indicates that he has enough of them. If he clicks on the “upgrade” button he will have to wait for 41 minutes and 28 seconds for the upgrade to finish and for the level of the building to rise.

### Meth Lab

![](/img/help/image128.jpg)

The Meth Lab has a medium production of drugs and first to consider if you want to produce drugs seriously. In the example above, a player has production of 18.14 thousand drugs with this building per day while he will have that one of 21.98 when he upgrades the building to level 6\. Since the resources are in white, it indicates he has enough of them.

### Cocina

![](/img/help/image46.jpg)

Cocina is the second drug production building with medium production. Costs of her upgrade are much higher than of other buildings but so is her production. In the example above, a player produces 54.43 thousands drugs with it per day while he would produce 65.94 thousand when he upgrades it to the next level. Cost for upgrades in white indicates that a player has enough of them while the red amount of weapons and alcohol shows that player does not have enough. Lack of necessary resources has disabled the upgrade button which now has “miss resources” instead but instant upgrades with crypto are still available.

### Pharmaceutical Lab

![](/img/help/image126.jpg)

Pharmaceutical lab is the most expensive drug production building but it is also the one which has the highest production. It massively produces drugs and you will not go wrong if you focus on upgrading it regularly to ensure your dominance in the game. In the example above, a player produces 153.86 thousands of drugs with this building per day at level 6 while he would produce 181.2 thousand on the next, seventh level. All his resources needed for the upgrade are in the red which indicates he is lacking them and can only be upgraded by paying with crypto.

### Drug Storage

![](/img/help/image41.jpg)

Drug storage is the only drug building that does not produce drugs. This building has two functions, it stores drugs and it keeps them safe. A player CANNOT have an infinite amount of drugs. The maximum amount of drugs that a player may hold is defined with drug storage and by upgrading its level, the storage increases. There is a possibility that some other building requires more drugs than a player can have unless he upgrades the storage enough. For example, a building needs 500K drugs for the upgrade but the maximum that a player can have is 450K. He will not be able to collect that amount of drugs if he does not upgrade his drug storage accordingly. All drug production that is above the storage capacity is NOT saved anywhere and is going to waste to upgrade your storage to make sure you are not producing drugs for nothing.

The second function this building has is the safe. A certain amount of drugs are being kept safe in the building and can not be stolen in battles when a player loses. With each level, the amount that is safe from stealing increases so a player even when losing a battle will not lose all of his resources.

Drug Storage is limited to the level of the Headquarters. If the Headquarters is level 10, Drug Storage can be up to level 10.

## Weapon

Weapons are the second resource in CrossWars. There are needed for upgrades of buildings and purchases of units. This resource (just as any other) can get stolen if a player loses a battle but he can keep a portion of it safe by upgrading his weapon storage. Each building has the following information: level of the building that is over the image, name, cost for the next upgrade in resource under the name and in crypto for instant upgrade, description, and the amount of production on current and next level per day. Each building associated with weapons requires resources of drugs and alcohols for its upgrade while the weapon storage needs all 3 resources.

### Ammunition Factory

Ammunition factory is the basic weapon production building that is very cheap to upgrade but also produces the least weapons in comparison with other buildings. This building is a good thing to start with when you are first starting to play the game so your production increases in time and you can afford to upgrade more useful ones. In the picture above is the example of how on current level 18 a player produces 14.68 thousand weapons every day with this building while he will produce 15.63 thousand weapons on level 19\. Since the resources are in white, it indicates he has enough of them. If he clicks on the “upgrade” button he would have to wait for 46 minutes and 38 seconds for the upgrade to finish and for the building to rise in level.

### Weapon Factory

![](/img/help/image127.jpg)

This building is next in line when it comes to producing weapons. It is still in the category of fairly cheap buildings when it comes to producing weapons. In the picture above is the example of how on current level 11 a player produces 25.32 thousand weapons per day with this building while he would produce 27.87 thousand on level 12\. Since the resources are in white, it indicates that he has enough of them. If he clicks on “upgrade” button he will have to wait for 55 minutes and 5 seconds for the upgrade to finish and for the level of the building to rise.

### Smuggle

![](/img/help/image85.jpg)

Smuggle is the building with medium production of weapons and first to consider if you want to produce weapons seriously. In the example above, a player has production of 50.86 thousand weapons with this building per day while he will have that one of 57.02 when he upgrades the building to level 10\. Since the resources are not all in white, it indicates he hasn't got enough of them. The only way to upgrade the building is by buying an instant upgrade with crypto or by waiting until he has enough resources for a time managed upgrade.

### Black Market

![](/img/help/image86.jpg)

Black Market is the second weapon building with medium production. Costs of her upgrade are much higher than of other buildings but so is her production. In the example above, a player produces 97.07 thousands weapons with it per day while he would produce 111.97 thousand when he upgrades it to the next level. Cost for upgrades in red indicates that a player hasn't got enough of them. Lack of necessary resources has disabled the upgrade button which now has “miss resources” instead but instant upgrades with crypto are still available.

### 3D Metal Printing

![](/img/help/image51.jpg)

3D metal printing is the most expensive weapon production building but it is also the one which has the highest production. It massively produces weapons and you will not go wrong if you focus on upgrading it regularly to ensure your dominance in the game. In the example above, a player produces 181.44 thousands of weapons with this building per day at level 5 while he would produce 219.8 thousand on the next, sixth level. All his resources needed for the upgrade are in the red which indicates he is lacking them and can only be upgraded by paying with crypto.

### Weapon Storage

With each level, the amount that is safe from stealing increases so a player even when losing a battle will not lose all of his resources. The example above shows the building that is currently under upgrade and will raise to level 20 in 1 hours 2 minutes and 50 seconds.

Weapon Storage is limited to the level of the Headquarters. If the Headquarters is level 10, Weapon Storage can be up to level 10.

## Alcohol

Alcohol is the third resource in CrossWars. It is needed for upgrades of buildings and purchases of units. This resource (just as any other) can get stolen if a player loses a battle but he can keep a portion of it safe by upgrading his alcohol silo. Each building has the following information: level of the building that is over the image, name, cost for the next upgrade in resource under the name and in crypto for instant upgrade, description, and the amount of production on current and next level per day. Each building associated with alcohol requires resources of drugs and weapons for its upgrade while the alcohol silo needs all 3 resources.
