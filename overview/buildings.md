# Buildings

Everything in DrugWars is in some way connected to buildings. A player produces resources with them, they allow the purchase and training of battle units, keep your resources safe, etc. There are five types of buildings, Office, Drugs, Weapons, and Alcohol buildings can be reached in the left menu by clicking on Buildings, while Gang Buildings are available through the Gang tab in the left menu. To learn about what each individual building produces and how it functions read Production.

Each building has information about the required resources for its upgrade just below its title, description, current production and the production that will happen with the next upgrade, the time required for upgrade, and two upgrade links: normal (top one in green color) and instant one bottom one in yellow color).

If you have all the resources necessary, they will be in white color while the UPGRADE button will be green. If you are missing resources, they will be in red color while the UPGRADE button will say “MISS RESOURCES” and be black.

Every upgrade requires a certain amount of time to be completed which is different for each building. Once you click on the UPGRADE button, your resources will be lowered by the amount needed for the upgrade (spent), the upgrade will start and your building will rise in its level, by one, when the set time has passed. If you want an instant upgrade, click on the yellow button that says how much crypto you will spend on it. The instant upgrade will raise your building level immediately and instead of spending your resources, you will pay for it with crypto. If you do not have enough crypto for the upgrade, this option will not be available and the button will be black instead of yellow.

## Office

Office buildings do not create resources but they are the ones that make it possible for other buildings to create them. In that way, they are the most important ones because they impact other buildings and condition if you can upgrade them or not. To learn about each office building and how it functions, read about it in Office Production.
