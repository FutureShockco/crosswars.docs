# How the Prize Pool works

Daily rewards are dependent on investments from all players when they purchase instant upgrades with crypto. The game release 1% of the total prize pool everyday. So if there are 250.000 CWD in the prize pool smart contract, the game will deliver 2500 CWD the first day, 2475 the second day, etc... Obviously those numbers can get bigger too day by day.

## Production
25% of the total daily rewards goes to all players depending of their credit production ingame.

## Fights
50% of the total daily rewards is available for players who killed units in the last 24 hours. Remember if nobody fights or kill units, the dedicated amount stays in the prize pool.

## Burn ingame resources
15% of the total daily rewards goes to players depending who burnt their credit production ingame in the last 24 hours.

## Jobs
10% of the total daily rewards is available for players who completed jobs in the last 24 hours. Remember if nobody finish jobs, the dedicated amount stays in the prize pool.
