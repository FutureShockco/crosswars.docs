## Why Polygon Network?

Polygon is, to this day, the most well-built and user-friendly platform for Ethereum. It provides a variety of solutions for Ethereum’s pain points such as scalability, high gas fee, and infrastructure development while maintaining a high level of security. Moreover, Polygon enables true interoperability by embracing the multi-chain ecosystem of Ethereum, hence the title “Ethereum’s internet of blockchains”. Polygon is specially tailored for mass adoption which is exactly what gaming in the blockchain is going towards.
