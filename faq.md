## Are bots allowed in the game?

DrugWars does not tolerate any bot automating any action in the game. This gives unfair advantage to some players and exploits the game. Bot usage is strictly monitored. Abusers will be banned immediately upon being flagged for abuse. You have the right to one appeal as to why you were flagged to explain why it may be false. After, if the infraction is the same, you are banned.

## Why is my shared battle not upvoted?

Higher Pantheon building levels will produce higher upvote values but not all shared battles will be upvoted. Sharing a battle gives you A CHANCE of being upvoted. Upvoting battles is not mandatory or guaranteed.

## Is being in the gang better than playing solo?

The answer depends on what kind of style a player prefers. Gang members play together and socialize more, offer protection and go on missions together. Individual players can enjoy the game and play it but some features of the game are only available to gangs since they are specifically designed for them and require more players.

## Can I have more than one DrugWars account?

Yes, you can. If you have more than one Steem account, you can play DrugWars with each one of them individually. Additionally, you can create a DrugWars account by logging in with your social media account.

## Why are daily rewards going up and down?

Daily rewards are dependent on investments from all players when they purchase instant upgrades with crypto. There will be days when a lot of players will purchase upgrades and the prize will get bigger just as there will be days when more players will purchase upgrades with resources and the prize will be smaller.

## My daily rewards are dependent on which base?

You will get your daily prize based on your total drug production which is calculated by adding drug productions from all the bases. You can see your total drug production in the Overview.

## How do I know which base I am currently on?

There is information under your logo image and in the upper right corner of the main screen. Read Player location on the map

## Why are my resources in red and will not go higher than a certain amount?

You can not have unlimited amounts of resources. The capacity of each resource is determined with the storage building for that resource. Higher levels will allow you bigger storage just as they will allow you bigger safe storage. Upgrade your storage buildings and you will be able to store more resources.

## Can someone steal my base?

No. Players can attack bases and steal resources but they can not destroy bases.

## Can I share my resources with other players?

You can transfer your resources by clicking on Actions and then on transfer. Keep in mind that those resources need to be carried by units and different units have different carry capacities. To learn more, read Sharing resources with other players

## Why didn't I get any resources after winning a battle?

If your opponent had no resources then you had nothing to steal. Keep in mind that each battle has a small time delas and a notification to your opponent. In this time, your opponent has the chance to prepare for the battle, get more units, relocate or spend his resources.

## Do I have to battle other players?

You do not have to attack other players if you do not want to but you will have to defend yourself if they attack you, so have enough units ready. You can keep upgrading your buildings and receiving rewards based on your production but keep in mind that battles are a way to get more of those resources by looting.

## What is Steem Engine?

Steem Engine is a smart contracts side-chain platform for the Steem blockchain. This means that it can execute custom smart contracts based on data published to the Steem blockchain. DWD tokens are created on Steem Engine. Visit it by clicking on https://steemscan.com/steem-engine. You will need to log in through SteemConnect by using your steem login data.

## How can I buy DWD tokens on Steem Engine and transfer them to DrugWars?

Log in to Steem Engine platform. To find DWD, enter its name in the search area. You will see a similar line to the one you have in your wallet. It will look like this:

![](/img/help/image53.png)

The line will have the information about the total DWD tokens on Steem Engine. To buy some of them, click on the second icon, the one with two little arrows on it. This will open the market page. You could have come to this step by clicking on that same icon in your wallet, next to DWD tokens. On that market page, below the Market Depth graph of DWD, you will see the following:

![](/img/help/image52.png)

This is the place where you can either SELL your tokens for steem or BUY them. We will cover the BUY part in this tutorial but the SELL part is very similar except the obvious difference that you are selling and not buying. To BUY tokens, keep in mind that you are buying them with STEEMP so make sure you have STEEMP in your Steem Engine account. STEEMP is pegged to the value of STEEM and to have STEEMP you need to deposit STEEM into Steem Engine. You can learn how to do that by reading the FAQ on the Steem Engine platform. (In short: click on your user name in the upper right corner - click on conversion history - click on deposit)

![](/img/help/image13.png)

In the example above, a person wants to buy 2 DWD tokens. She needs to enter numbers in the first and second blank area. Given the information underneath, about the lowest ask of 0.079, she entered 0.08 for the price of the token and she entered 2 for the number of tokens she will buy. The total comes to 0.16 Steem and is calculated automatically by the platform. The balance this person has is listed below and since the total in this purchase is lower than the balance, the purchase will be able to go through. Keep in mind that these numbers here are for this example ONLY and may not be the same based on how the market value of the token changes. When you are at this stage of the process, click on the brown BUY DWD button to go to the next step which is the confirmation screen that will look like this:

![](/img/help/image55.png)

Review what you have done and if you are satisfied click on the BUY button. This will initiate a process where you will see the code of the transaction. Just click on the green CONTINUE button. You will have to login with steem connect:

![](/img/help/image79.png)

After you enter your information and click on GET STARTED you will have to allow the transaction so click on the green APPROVE button. This will get you the number of your transaction. At the same time the window for steem connect has opened, another one, in blue colour has opened too. It is normal to have those two opened at the same time at this part of the process. When you are done with the steem connect and get the information about your code, you can close it. You will continue this process with the other window that has opened and which will look like this:

![](/img/help/image83.png)

CLICK on TRANSACTION SENT just like the explanation in that window is telling you to. This is it, you have successfully purchased DWD tokens on Steem Engine and they will be visible in your Steem Engine wallet shortly.

To send your tokens from Steem Engine to your DrugWars account, you first need to have them on Steem Engine. This can be done by buying them (as we have just described), getting them from other users or by having them after you have withdrawn them from the game. Maybe you have changed your mind and want them back, it really does not matter. As long as you have DWD tokens on Steem Engine, you can transfer them to the game. Remember that line, with the info about the token, in your Steem Engine wallet? The one that looks like this:

![](/img/help/image32.png)

There are icons at the end of the line. Click on the second one from the right, the one that looks like a little arrow is coming out of the box. It will open the following:

![](/img/help/image103.png)

The TRANSFER window is pretty simple. Enter the amount you want to send to your account and where it says "TO", YOU MUST TYPE IN DrugWars just as it is typed in the example above. You do not have to put in the @ sign, it is already there, just type “drugwars” as seen in the above image. Tokens will arrive at your account in the DrugWars game. If you are sending to Server 1 Detroit, the memo can remain blank. If you are sending to Server 2 LA, enter “s2” in the Memo field. If you do not enter s2, it will go to server 1 by default. Click on the brown SEND DWD button and the transfer process will begin. It will be very similar to the one where you are buying tokens because you will get the screen with the code where you need to click on continue:

![](/img/help/image118.png)

You will need to log in with your steem connect information, click on "Get started", and approve the transaction in the next step:

![](/img/help/image107.png)

After you have logged in with steem connect and approved your transaction, that blue screen will still be waiting for you, the same one that you get when you are buying tokens and looks like this:

![](/img/help/image83.png)

Click on TRANSACTION SENT. Those two screens, the blue one and the steem connect one, open at the same time, do not be alarmed by this. Simply focus on steem connect and once you are done and have closed it, finish with the blue screen. This is it! You have successfully transferred tokens from Steem Engine to your DrugWars account and you will be able to see them in the game shortly after you have completed this process.

## How can I withdraw my DWD tokens from the game to Steem Engine?

To withdraw your DWD tokens from DrugWars game to Steem Engine, you first need to click on the MARKET link in the left menu of DrugWars. It will open the "Market" part of the platform in the main screen. You will see the SHOP link opened automatically. To be able to withdraw your tokens, click on the EXCHANGE link which is located next to SHOP.

![](/img/help/image12.jpg)

You will see the information about how many tokens you have in the game. You can withdraw up to the amount you have, from 1 as the minimum to your amount as the maximum. Simply enter the number in the field and click on WITHDRAW. Your entered number must be an integer. You can not withdraw decimal amounts. When you have clicked on the green withdraw button, a small message of confirmation will appear in the bottom left corner:

![](/img/help/image102.png)

All you need to do now is go to your Steem Engine account and click on WALLET in the menu at the top of the page. There you will see all of your tokens including DWD. Keep in mind that you will sometimes need to wait a short period of time for tokens to arrive. You will see a line in your wallet with the information about how much tokens you have and what their price is.

![](/img/help/image32.png)

In the example above, there are 115 tokens in the wallet and those 115 are worth $0.73 with the percentage telling you how much the price has gone up, if green, or gone down, if the percentage will be in red. There are 4 little icons at the end of that line. If you move your mouse over them, you will see how they are links to information, market, send tokens, and token history. Now that you have your tokens on Steem Engine, you can sell them or send them to others. THAT IS IT! You have successfully withdrawn your tokens from the game to Steem Engine.

## Why does the price of DWD tokens keep changing?

As with any other token, the market determines its price. You can see that all tokens on Steem Engine change their price not only from one day to another but from one hour to another depending on the demand.
