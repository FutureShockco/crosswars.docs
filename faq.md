# Frequently asked questions

## Is being in the gang better than playing solo?

It depends on the player's playing style preferences and habits. Being in a gang means that the player isn't playing alone and is leaning towards socialization more, it also means that the gang members are protecting each other and go on missions together. Whereas, the individual player is enjoying the game differently and focuses on his own strength to advance. Notice that some features are only available to gangs as they require more players to participate and are specifically designed for groups.

## Can I have more than one CrossWars account?

Yes, you can. If you have more than one polygon wallet, you can play CrossWars with each one of them individually.

## Why are daily rewards going up and down?

Daily rewards are dependent on investments from all players when they purchase instant upgrades with crypto. It means that when a player purchases an instant upgrade, the amount will go to the prize pool that releases 1% of it everyday. In that sense, there will be days when a lot of players will purchase upgrades and the prize will get bigger just as there will be days when more players will upgrade with resources and the prize will be smaller.

## My daily rewards depend on which base?

 The daily prize is based on the total credit production which is calculated by adding the credit productions from all the bases. 
 
## Where can I see my total credit productions?

It is possible to quickly get the total credit productions from any players at the Hall of Fame. 

## How do I know which base I am currently on?

There is information under your logo image and in the upper right corner of the main screen. Read Player location on the map

## Why are my resources in red and will not go higher than a certain amount?

You can not have unlimited amounts of resources. The capacity of each resource is determined with the storage building for that resource. Higher levels will allow you bigger storage just as they will allow you bigger safe storage. Upgrade your storage buildings and you will be able to store more resources.

## Can someone steal my base?

No. Players can attack bases and steal resources but they can not destroy bases.

## Can I share my resources with other players?

You can transfer your resources by clicking on Actions and then on transfer. Keep in mind that those resources need to be carried by units and different units have different carry capacities. To learn more, read Sharing resources with other players

## Why didn't I get any resources after winning a battle?

If your opponent had no resources then you had nothing to steal. Keep in mind that each battle has a small time delay and a notification to your opponent. In this time, your opponent has the chance to prepare for the battle, get more units, relocate or spend his resources.

## Do I have to battle other players?

You do not have to attack other players if you do not want to but you will have to defend yourself if they attack you, so have enough units ready. You can keep upgrading your buildings and receiving rewards based on your production but keep in mind that battles are a way to get more of those resources by looting.

## Why does the price of CWD tokens keep changing?

As with any other token, the market determines its price. You can see that all tokens on CoinMarketCap change their price not only from one day to another but from one hour/minute to another depending on the demand.
