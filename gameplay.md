## Units

Units are expendable pieces of the CrossWars game. They are purchased, trained and used in battles. When a unit dies in battle, the player's number of that unit decreases by the number that had just died but he can buy more as often and as much as he wants. There is no limit to quantity or quality of the units.To be able to purchase units, a player must first have the Training facility building and if he wants to train them then he needs to have the Research Center. Both of those buildings are office buildings and can be upgraded accordingly.

Each unit is unique in her skill set and cost. Some units are malee which means they are for close combat while some are range or battling from a distance. Units are the only thing in the CrossWars game that have a number over the picture that does not stand for level. Whenever you see a number over an image in CrossWars with buildings or training, it represents the level while with units, it represents the number of units that a player currently has.

Each unit has the following information next to it: picture and number of units a player has over it, description and info about unique abilities, cost in resources, supply, offense and resistance skills, time needed for time managed recruitment, and the cost for recruitment paid with crypto. Time needed for time managed recruitment can be shortened with higher levels of Training Facility building.

### Recruiting Units

To recruit (purchase) units, a player needs to have the necessary resources (different for different units), enter the amount he wants to recruit in the white space and click on the green recruit button. If resources are missing, the green recruit button will be replaced with black one that says “missing resources”. A player can, at any time, choose to recruit his units by paying for them with crypto in which case the resources are not necessary and the purchase is instant and not time managed.

#### Hobo

Hobo is the cheapest unit to recruit and the only one that requires only one resource for purchase. This unit has no defense and will die if he meets his enemy at the end of the first round. Hobos are fairly slow and can not carry much which means they are not very good for sending resources to other players.![](/img/help/image9.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.2 Rowdy

Rowdy is a unit that fights in groups of four so be sure to always send rowdies to battle in a number that can be divided by 4 to assure their maximum efficiency. Rowdy has no defense against fire and chemical weapons and can defend only against physical damage and bullets.![](/img/help/image125.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.3 Super Bouncer

Super bouncer is a medium strong unit for close combat but has a fairly weak defense. His special ability is his shield which he can use once and obtain +200 more health which makes him harder to kill in battles.![](/img/help/image54.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.4 Big Mama

Big Mama is the only unit with healing abilities because she can heal up to 5 units for 200HP in every round. She is fairly slow but has medium offense and defense and is not an easy unit to kill.![](/img/help/image19.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.5 Knifer

Knifer is a solid unit when it comes to his skills in battle but be careful because this unit does not follow rules. This means that he does not follow priority in battles and can attack sooner or later than he is supposed to.![](/img/help/image16.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.6 Gunman

Gunman is a pretty strong range unit that takes out melee units from a safe distance. His aim is almost perfect so his accuracy ensures bonus damage. His defense is low, however, because he is not very good at defending himself in close combat.![](/img/help/image25.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.7 Lawyer

Not all men are born for fighting, some have other useful skills. If you send a lawyer in battle, he will reduce the amount your opponent has in his safe by 0.01% which means you can steal even some resources that your opponent is not expecting you too, up to 5% that are in his safe. This unit is a genius in battle but will hide behind big mama to protect himself.![](/img/help/image77.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.8 Spy

Spy is not a good choice for battles but an excellent one for spying. Before starting a normal attack, a player can send only a spy in battle and his spy will return with valuable information about the opponent such as buildings and number of units an opponent has. With knowing what units will wait for him, players can strategize and choose which units to send in battle more carefully.![](/img/help/image29.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.9 Sniper

Sniper is an excellent choice for battles. He is a range unit that kills your opponents units from a distance with increases to his damage with each round. His damage will be greater by 1.5*x where x is the number of rounds which means he will deal the most damage in the last round.![](/img/help/image122.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.10 Hitman

Hitman is a strong range unit that a player can not go wrong with. This unit has a special ability of a multiple hit because he takes down two targets at once with his two guns, one in each hand. He is fast and with excellent offense and defense skills.![](/img/help/image40.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.11 Ninja

Ninja is the second female unit. She has cat-like reflexes and you can say she has more than one life just as a cat. Ninja can dodge two deadly hits and it doesn't even matter how strong they are. This, in combination with her great offense skills, makes her quite powerful. ![](/img/help/image62.png)

##### 3.1.2.1.12 Bazooka Guy

![](/img/help/image70.jpg)

Bazooka guy is a good unit to have if you want to up your chances of winning a battle. This unit will hit not one, not two but 10 enemies at once and is generally very good with all his offense skills.

#####  3.1.2.1.13 Occupation Troop

![](/img/help/image92.jpg)

This is the only unit which is not used in battles. To occupy a territory and create a new base, a player needs to send this unit in to make room. This unit is slow but can carry a lot and is safe from attacks so if you want to expand your empire and create more bases, send these in. The Occupation Troop is disposable, it creates the new base and is consumed into it. Once you send it to create a new base, the unit is gone. Your new base is created instantaneously.

##### 3.1.2.1.14 Mercenary

![](/img/help/image97.jpg)

Mercenary is the most expensive unit but also the strongest one. This unit has exceptional defense and offense skills and will help you win in battles. His unique skills is his bulletproof vest which helps him to obtain back 25HP when re reaches 0 so just as your opponent will think your mercenary is dead, surprise, no he is not.

#### 3.1.2.1 Training units

Unit training is an option that every player can take advantage of. To be able to train their units, players first need to have the Research Center building and all training can go as much up in levels as the Research Center. If your Research Center is level 10, your training levels are limited to level 10\. Some training affects all units while others are specifically designed for some or only specific type of units. Each training has the following information next to the image: description, unique advantage, cost in resources, time required for time managed upgrades and the price for instant upgrade in crypto.

##### 3.1.2.1.1\. Routing

![](/img/help/image64.jpg)

Routing is training of all units in speed. With each level, all units will have increased speed by 0.5%.

##### 3.1.2.1.2\. Close Combat

![](/img/help/image95.jpg)

Close combat is training of only melee units (those who fight in close combat) in physical damage. With each level, melee units will increase the physical damage they give in battles by 1%.

##### 3.1.2.1.3\. Introduction to pistol, rifle, and shotgun

![](/img/help/image26.jpg)

This training is only for range units and it has the same function as close combat has for melee. Pistol, rifle & shotgun will increase the physical damage units give in battles by 1% with each level of training.

##### 3.1.2.1.4\. Information procurement

##### 3.1.2.1.6\. Spirit wine

![](/img/help/image90.jpg)

Spirit wine is training specifically designed for the Hobo unit. Since this unit is fairly weak and dies when he meets his enemy at the end of the round, training it seems logical. With each level of training Hobos will give 1% more physical damage to their opponents.

##### 3.1.2.1.7\. Coordination

![](/img/help/image45.jpg)

## 3.2 Player location on the map![](/img/help/image108.jpg)

Once you click on the Map in the left menu, a rotating Earth image will appear in the main frame. You will notice how it has a lot of small hexagons on it. Each hexagon is one territory and every such territory has 225 possible base locations. You will also notice how those hexagons are in different colors. There is black, green, yellow, orange, red, and blue. Those colors indicate how dangerous a specific territory is where black is empty, green means that there is an inexistent or low danger, yellow is moderate and orange and red considerable and even high. Only blue locations are different because they are implicating how there will soon be missions on them.

Every player has one free base location to choose. That primary base has no required resources or obligations for a player in any way, it is completely free and simple to choose. Every player can set up to 5 bases if he wishes (they are not mandatory) but those 4 additional ones require some investment in the terms of purchasing a special unit that will establish them.

### 3.2.1 Choosing primary base location

![](/img/help/image42.jpg)

When you log into the CrossWars game, it will tell you how you need to choose a location on the map first. Until you do that, you will not be able to play the game or see the resources that you have. You can either click on the green link under your image that says "SELECT THE LOCATION" or click on the map in the left menu. Both will get you to the same place, they will open the rotating world map with hexagons on it.

To pick your primary base, click on the map in the left menu. When the world map appears in the main frame you can either watch how it spins and look at different territories or you can click and drag your mouse to rotate it manually. When you click on any hexagon territory, a small window will pop-up next to it with the information on how many bases are already in that territory and how many are free. Keep in mind that it is giving you information about bases, not players. If it says there are 4 bases there, it can mean that those 4 bases can be owned by 1,2,3, or 4 different players. When you have chosen your preferred territory, click on the hexagon that represents it.

![](/img/help/image116.jpg)

Once you have clicked on the territory, base locations will open in a grid. Every territory grid has 225 base locations. Those which are in red color have already been claimed by another player and you can find out who by clicking on them. Those which are in black color are free and available for you to choose them as your primary base location.

![](/img/help/image44.jpg)

From those available black base locations, you need to choose one for your primary base. When you click on the one you desire, you will need to confirm it by clicking on the blue button CHOOSE AS PRIMARY BASE. Your base will from then on be colored green in the base grid of that territory and the information about your primary base location will be under your image and in the right corner of the main frame. Those players that will have more than one location will always know which base they are on by reading what it says in that right corner or under their image. The first number is territory while the second one is the base in that territory. In the example below, the primary base is territory 442 and location 1.

![](/img/help/image36.jpg)

### 3.2.2 Choosing secondary base locations

Every player can have up to 9 additional bases (a total of 10, 1 primary and 9 additional). The process is very similar to choosing the primary base except it requires a special unit called Occupation Troop. A player must first recruit this unit to be able to get an additional base with it.

![](/img/help/image28.jpg)

Occupational troop has the potential to create a new base. If you use it for that purpose, it will transform itself into the base which means that you will not have that unit anymore. The unit will not return once the base is set because the unit has become the base itself. In addition to occupying territory and creating bases, this unit can also transport resources from one base to another and station units. This is a good thing to do in order to assure enough resources in additional bases to start building upgrades and unit recruitment.

When you choose your base location (in the same way as for the primary one) and click on a base in the desired territory, the blue button will now say CREATE NEW BASE. Once you click on it, it will divert you to choose the unit for that action. You need to select one Occupational troop by entering the number in the blank space and clicking on the image of the unit (just as you would select units for battle). Your coordinates will already be set but you can change them if you wish and you need to enter the name of your new base. When you have your occupational troop selected, coordinates of the base, and the new base name, click on OCCUPY and your base will be created.

Each player can have 10 bases, so you can create up to 9 additional bases in addition to your primary base.

### 3.2.3 Production of buildings and units

Each base has its own production, buildings, and units. From the Headquarters to Alcohol Silo, players can upgrade their buildings in every base individually. It is like playing five games at once if you have 5 base locations. Those upgrades can be simultaneous so while you are upgrading the Cocina in one base there is no problem in upgrading Black Market in another and the Bar in the next. The same goes for recruiting units.

Be careful what you are building and where. Before starting any upgrade make sure that you are doing it in the base that you want. You can always see which base you are on because it is stated under your image and in the upper right corner of the main frame. To switch between locations, simply click on the small arrow next to the primary base to expand the list of bases and click on the one you want. Once you do that, the chosen base will be the one you are currently in. By producing resources in more than one base and transporting them, you will not only collect them faster and be able to upgrade more buildings but also have bigger drug production and as a result, higher daily rewards. Your information about resource production in the top banner will change according to the base you are currently on but you can see your total production from all bases if you click on overview in the left menu. That total production is what your daily prize is based upon.Your daily prize is for your total drug production from all bases added together.

Since you can station units from one base in another one, it would be silly that 5 of your hobos were trained to level 6, for example, and another 15 to level 2\. All your units are at the same level of any training at all times. This means that training will not be different from one base to another. It will be the same. By upgrading training in one base, it will automatically rise in level in all base locations once the upgrade is finished.

## 3.3 Battles

Battling against other players is the key feature of the CrossWars game. By attacking other players and by defending themselves against attacks, players can get rewarded in more than one way. Each battle will assure that some amount of resources from the opponent goes to the winner of the fight and based on how much he reduced the CrossWars population, players will receive additional daily reward in crypto. You can read about the rewards from battles here Battle prize.

### 3.3.1 Preparing for a battle

A player can not attack other players if there are no units to go to that attack. To be able to attack, there first need to be units present. In order to have a bigger chance of victory, those units can be trained and the target should be chosen carefully. Additionally, there is a fight simulator that can help players see in advance how the fight is going to look like. If the opponent does not change his unit number and defensive buildings in the meantime, the attacker can expect the battle to go as the simulator predicted.

#### 3.3.1.1 Unit production and training

To be able to participate in battles, players need to produce their units and train them if they want to assure their skills are even better. Unit production can be at every single base while unit training is the same for all bases. To learn more about unit production and training, read Units.

#### 3.3.1.2 Choosing targets

The best way to assure your target is not too strong for you is to spy on it with the unit Spy. This unit will bring you back a lot of valuable information about how many units your opponent has and some other useful info. If that player does not produce more units in the meantime, you can assume he has what your Spy told you. Simply attack a player with the Spy unit and wait for it to return. To attack a player, you need to enter the location of his base you will attack or find the base on the map and attack from there.

#### 3.3.1.3 The fight simulator

Once you have learned how many units your opponent has, and you know which units you will send into battle, access the fight simulator here: https://simulator.drugwars.io/ and enter the numbers of units you both have. When you click on submit, the simulator will give you information about the battle process and what happens at each round. You will know who the winner will be of that potential fight too. To assure your victory, play with the simulator a bit and enter different unit numbers for your attack. This way you will see different scenarios that may take place. Keep in mind that since all battles have a time delay, the simulator information will be true only if your opponent does not make any changes to his units in the meantime.

#### 3.3.1.4 Unit order and grouping

When starting a fight, a player needs to know how there is an attack order among units. That order can be seen in units.json file of CrossWars GitHub and it goes like this: Spy, Hobo, Rowdy, Bouncer, Knifer, Big Mamma, Lawyer, Ninja, Gunman, Sniper, Hitman, Bazooka, Mercenary. This means that Bouncers, for example, will always attack before Gunman and so on.

The same units are grouped together, they fight together and their progress in the simulator is shown one after another. If a player goes into battle with 2 Super Bouncers, those 2 Super Bouncers will attack together and their information will be presented one line at a time.

### 3.3.2 Battle process

The battle takes place in rounds and it ends either when all the units from one side are dead or until all rounds are finished. Attacking units can only attack one of the opposing team's groups per round and both the attack and the defend side units are in the battle based on their unit order. At each round the unit may lose its HP based on its defense and the attacker strength on it. For example, a layer with 2000 HP and 50 DEF can take 450 DMG from Big Mamma and his HP will drop to 1550 HP. If there are 5 Big Mammas, they will deal 5*450=2250 DMG and the lawyer will be dead.

Since damage goes both ways, be sure that lawyer units will be protected by Big Mamma units. He will assign 120 DMG to Big Mamma and get her HP from 21000 to 20880\. To simplify, let us see what happens with one Lawyer and one Big Mamma:

Lawyer: HP 2000, attack 200, and defense 50

Big Mamma: HP 21000, attack 500, and defence 80

Big Mamma attacks Lawyer with an attack of strength 500 but since he has a defense of 50, the attack he gets is 450 which means his HP gets from 2000 to 1550\. At the same time, while defending himself, he deals Big Mamma damage of 200 but since Big Mamma has defence of 80, she gets 120 damage (because 200-80=120) and her HP is now 20880.

Each round can be seen as the attack on one defending unit where the attacking units take turns at attacking while the defending unit gives them some damage during his defending. For example, if there are 2 Bouncers, 2 Big Mammas and 1 Knifer attacking 5 Rowdies and 5 Lawyers, one round will be the attack on Rowdies and another round will be the attack on Lawyers. All Bouncers, Big Mammas and Knifer will attack Rowdies and assign damage, Rowdies will give them damage during defense. All Bouncers, Big Mammas and Knifer will attack Lawyers and assign damage, Lawyers will give them damage during defense. If there are units still left alive, the process continues. This, of course, depends on the training of the units too since different training will help units be better at attacking and defending themselves.

### 3.3.3 Battle rewards

The winner of the battle gets to loot the loser. The amount of resources the winner can loot is defined with how much of those resources the loser has and is not in the safe just as it is defined with the winning units that have survived. Each unit has a carry capacity and only surviving units can carry loot back home. For example, Super Bouncer can carry 400 and if there are 5 alive after battle, they can carry 2000 resources. Winner can loot all 3 resources, drugs, weapons, and alcohol.

### 3.3.4 Sharing Battles

Once a battle is over, players can share it in different social media networks: CrossWars forum, facebook, reddit, twitter, by creating a qr code, VK, and on Telegram. You first need to click on show more details when scrolling through previous battles and just under your rewards there will be a series of links you can click on to share your battle.

![](/img/help/image56.jpg)

## 3.4 Heist

Every player has an opportunity for extra daily income from Heirs. You can invest your drugs and based on your investment in comparison from other players, get crypto in return. A certain percentage of total daily prizes goes to heist (usually 2%) which is somewhere from 10K to 15K. Players who invest more in the heist will get a bigger piece of that prize while those who invest less will get less. Since you can invest as many times as you want during the day, information about your prize will be temporary because other players are also investing which means you have to keep a close eye and invest more accordingly if you want a bigger reward.

## 3.5 Jobs![](/img/help/image21.png)

Jobs are an important aspect of the game. By doing jobs, you fight the DRUGWARS NPC (their army / units) and take rewards for doing so. While your production of drugs, weapons and alcohol raises your levels for upgrades and recruiting units, completing jobs brings in much greater rewards. Each player is allowed to start 15 jobs per day, the day timer can be seen on the upper right portion of the screen. The timer starts a new day at 24 hours and ends once it reaches 0 (zero).

When doing jobs, whether solo jobs or gang jobs, the units used do not need to have the capacity to carry the rewards back. This differs from fights, where your attacking army can only bring back up to its capacity. This value can be seen under the unit’s Defense -> Carry attribute.

TIP: All units can carry resources, but if you plan to carry larger amounts, like 50k-100k+, you really need to utilize the AH-64 Apache unit which can carry up to 30k combined resources.

### 3.5.1 Jobs vs Gang Jobs

Jobs are individual, or solo, jobs where the job is done by the individual player and the rewards are given to the single player. A Gang Job is done by one to many gang members and the rewards are shared amongst the daily active members of the gang.

#### 3.5.1.1 Jobs

Individual Jobs are the #1 way to grow yourself in addition to letting your resources build. The rewards from these jobs are given to the individual player who does them. To do a job, you need to send an army of units capable of defeating the DRUSWARS NPC army. You can test this in the fight simulator (https://simulator.drugwars.io/).

#### 3.5.1.2 Gang Jobs

Whilst one to many members can participate in a Gang Job, oftentimes a single gang member can and will complete a job on their own. This is to the benefit of the gang as it usually results in the single member losing more resources than they gain. Gang Jobs promote teamwork and comradery within the gang. Gang Jobs are a great way for the gang to help each other, especially the younger and newer members.

TIP: It is important to remember that the Gang Job is shared amongst all daily active members. So the more members you have, the more members take a share. The share is distributed evenly, so those who participate do not receive any more than those who do not.
