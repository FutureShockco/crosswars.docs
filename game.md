## Introduction

CrossWars is an online game built on blockchain technology that combines MMORPG and MMORTS into one PvP gaming experience that provides monetized prizes that are awarded daily. Players receive cryptocurrency for their achievements in the game every 24 hours. Playing the game is currently completely free of charge although there are options of payment to speed up various game components and increase the chances of receiving a bigger payout at the end of the day. The player can choose in which cryptocurrency he or she will receive the prize while the default currency is set on that one of the CrossWars game.

#### 2.2.3.2 Training

![](/img/help/image48.jpg)

To be able to see the training a player first needs to have the Research Center built from the Office buildings. Once the Research Center is built, 13 training options will be available. Each training has levels for upgrading and is helping players units to be better in battles by increasing their various skills. Every training option has the following info: name, type, cost, description, time needed for recruitment and the cost for instant recruit. Instant recruit is paid with crypto and does not remove your resources. Upgrading your Research Center building lets you have more levels for upgrades of trainings. Training levels can not be higher than the Research Center so if you, for example, have a Research Center at level 4, all your trainings can go up to level 4\.

### 2.2.3.4 Unit Attributes

Units have the following attributes:

1.  Cost: this is the cost of drugs, weapons and alcohol to produce the number of units in the box.
2.  Supply: this is a power multiplier and maintenance requirement. The larger the number, the more power the unit brings to attacks. This value is also used in the Bunker, each unit requires the specified number of storage spaces. Example, if your Bunker has a capacity of 1000, one AH-64 Apache will require 10 of that 1000 to protect.
3.  Cluster: this is how many of the unit will attack per iteration. If there is a cluster of 100 and you have 200 units, they will attack in 2 groups of 100.
4.  Offensive -> Attack: The strength of attack.
5.  Offensive -> Carry: The amount of combined resources the unit can carry.
6.  Defensive -> Health: The hit points a unit can take before being killed.
7.  Defensive -> Resistance: This is the “shielding” value for the unit.
8.  Extra -> Speed: The amount of time it takes to transport the unit. Transporting 1 unit takes this amount of time and transporting 100 of the same unit also takes this amount of time. Increasing or decreasing the number of the unit does not change the time requirement.
9.  Extra -> Move Cost: This is the cost, in Cash, to move each unit. Moving one unit will cost the stated value. Moving 100 unites will cost the value * 100.

The name of each unit is followed by a category, either Melee or Range. Malee units are more the hand-to-hand combat units while the Range units attack from a distance.

### 2.2.4 Actions

![](/img/help/image72.jpg)

Actions is the place a player needs to go if he wants to attack other players, occupy a new base or transport resources and units to his bases. There are 4 additional tabs within actions, the first, attack, is automatically opened. That one is the only responsive one that allows players different actions while tabs out, in, and station are informative. They provide information about what is going on.

#### 2.2.4.1 Actions

There are 4 actions a player can take. He can ATTACK one of his opponents, TRANSPORT resources to another base, OCCUPY a new base or STATION units to another base.

##### 2.2.4.1.1 Attack

![](/img/help/image18.jpg)

To attack someone, first select your army. It is done by typing in the number in the blank space below the image, then clicking on the image to add. To start a fight, target coordinates must be entered. A fight message is optional and should not be insulting or discriminating regarding gender, sexual and religious preferences, nationality, skin color, health etc. or it will be sanctioned by the developers and punished accordingly.

##### 2.2.4.1.2 Transport

![](/img/help/image89.jpg)

A player can both transport resources to one of his own bases or to another player. To be able to transport resources, there must be units selected who will carry those resources. After selecting units and resources, a player must enter the coordinates of the base where those resources must go and click on TRANSPORT. To learn more about sharing resources with other players, read Sharing resources with other players.

##### 2.2.4.1.3 Occupy

![](/img/help/image59.jpg)

To occupy a new base, a player must first have 1 occupation troop. It is not possible to occupy a new territory without this unit because the unit itself transforms into the base. Once the unit is selected, a player needs to enter the coordinates of the territory and choose a name for the new base. After the button OCCUPY is clicked on, new base will be created instantly. To learn more about occupying new bases, read Choosing secondary base locations.

##### 2.2.4.1.4 Station

To station units at another base, follow the same procedure as for the transport of resources. The only difference here is that you wont need to select resources, you will only need to select the units you wish to station at another base.

#### 2.2.4.2 Out

The out tab will show you information about outgoing actions, those that a player has started himself. Those actions will be listed with general information who won and lost but you can get more information if you simply click on the SHOW DETAILS. Since outgoing actions (just like incoming) have a time delay, there will be a number in the brackets that will indicate how many battles will happen. When a player clicks on OUT that has a number in the brackets, battles that will happen will be listed before those that already did with the exact time when the fight will happen.

#### 2.2.4.3 In

The in tab will show you information about incoming actions, those that a player did not start but were the actions invoked on him by other players. Those battles will be listed with general information who won and lost but you can get more information if you simply click on the SHOW DETAILS. Since incoming actions (just like outgoing) have a time delay, there will be a number in the brackets that will indicate how many battles will happen. When a player clicks on IN that has a number in the brackets, actions that will happen will be listed before those that already did with the exact time when the fight will happen.

#### 2.2.4.5 Station

Station tab is informative just like Out and In tabs. This one will provide information about units that are being stationed at a certain base. Station is a time delayed action and there will be a number in the brackets indicating how a stationing will happen. Station activities can be seen in Actions -> Station, there will be information on units and the time when they will arrive at the base. In the example below, there are no ingoing or outgoing actions but there is one station action that will happen which is indicated by the numbers in the brackets.

![](/img/help/image100.jpg)

### 2.2.5 Map

![](/img/help/image110.jpg)

Map is the place where a player chooses his main location and several additional ones. It is also the place where he can choose which location to attack and start a battle with a player that is on it. To choose any location either for his base or for attack, a simple click on the hexagon is needed. The Earth is interactive and is slowly spinning around its axis but a player can turn it around manually by clicking and moving his mouse. To learn about how you can choose your bases, read Player location on the map.

### 2.2.6 Leaderboards

Leaderboards is where you can see the list of top players in 6 categories of game play, Production, Prestige, Heist, Fight, Job and Lottery. Each list is generated based on the results of every player in the game. Hall of fame lists the top users in battles, Production lists the top players in production of the drug resource, and the Heist lists those who have won the most in the daily heist. There are bonus awards in crypto for players who are on the lists that can be seen next to the names of players.

#### 2.2.6.1 Production (PROD)<sup>[a]</sup>

![](/img/help/image133.jpg)

Production list has the names of the best players based on their Drug production. Production of weapons and alcohol are listed too but the list is generated solely on how much drugs a player produces. As long as a player is on the list, he or she will receive an additional prize in crypto that is listed right from the production info of each player. This reward is not the same as the daily reward for production, to read about the daily production reward, click here: Daily prize.

#### 2.2.6.2 Cruelty

#### 2.2.6.3 Heist

![](/img/help/image129.jpg)

Heist list has the names of players who have deposited the biggest drug amounts into heist. As long as the player is on the list, he or she will receive additional reward in crypto that is listed right from the amount of drugs deposited. This reward is not the same as the daily heist reward, to read about a daily heist reward, click here: Heist prize. To learn how you can invest your drugs into heists, click here: Heist.

#### 2.2.6.4 Fight

#### 2.2.6.5 Job

#### 2.2.6.6 Lottery

Jobs are solo jobs that are done by the individual player alone. Once the job is started, you have until the timer completes to finish the job. Finishing the job simply means that all the DRUGWARS NPC units need to be killed. Once complete, you receive the job rewards as stated.

#### 2.2.8.2 Gang Jobs

Gang Jobs are similar to regular Jobs, except they apply to the whole gang. One to many gang members may participate in a gang job and the rewards are shared amongst the active players for that day, plus an additional Gang Bonus.

## 2.3 Right menu

CrossWars is a game that financially rewards its players in cryptocurrency. The amount that is awarded each day is presented in the right menu which is composed of the Daily prizes info in 3 parts and the Heist. Prizes are independent of each other so each player can get a reward in all 4 categories or in none at all depending on his or her achievements in the game. The prizes are given every 24 hours and directly sent to players' CrossWars account.

### 2.3.1 Daily prizes info

Today's prize is the overall amount that is given to all players. It is divided into 3 parts, Battle, Daily, and Heist. Percentages show how much of the overall amount is attributed to each of those 3 categories of prizes. The information is highlighted yellow and located under the overall amount.![](/img/help/image69.jpg)

There is a countdown clock at the top of the right menu which is counting down the time until the next payment while the current awards which a player might get are under his banner production in a single sentence line. That info can change during the day depending on the actions of the player.

![](/img/help/image24.jpg)

#### 2.3.1.1 Daily Prize

Daily prize is the award a player gets based on drug production. It is calculated based on the percentage of drugs produced out of the total drug production of all players. Those who produce more drugs get a higher prize than those who have a smaller production and the prize can change with each day. If a player starts producing more drugs, this award will get bigger. It can also become smaller if the player stays on its current drug production and other players rise in theirs.

#### 2.3.1.2 Fight Prize

Fight prize is the prize a player gets based on how much he or she has reduced the population. In CrossWars, each unit has a supply characteristic. Population of CrossWars is calculated by multiplying a unit with its supply and adding up all those together from all units of all players. By participating in battles, a winning player kills units from other players, those units multiplied by their supply are the amount by which the overall population has been reduced. Since different units have different supplies, it is not the same to kill 100 Hobos (supply = 100*1 = 100) and 100 Ninjas (supply = 100*5 = 500) for example. At the end of each day, results from all the battles a player has won get added together and based on the total reduction of CrossWars population, a player gets rewarded. The info about current CrossWars population is below the prizes info in the right menu,

![](/img/help/image99.jpg)

#### 2.3.1.3 Heist Prize

Heist prize is the award a player gets by participating in the heist. Each day, every player can decide to invest his or her drug in the heist and get rewarded by it. Players who invest more get bigger rewards from those who invest less and since the prize is dependent on the investment of others, it may change during the day when others invest more than the player.

### 2.3.2 Heist![](/img/help/image1.jpg)

Every player has an option to invest drugs in the heist every day. It is done simply by entering the amount in the white space and clicking on Deposit. If a player wants to invest all drugs, there is a button Deposit all for that. A player can deposit drugs as many times as he wants during the day but those drugs that were invested cannot be gotten back.

## 2.4\. CrossWars Live Chat

![](/img/help/image68.jpg)

Live chat is located in the bottom right corner and it is collapsed by default. Clicking on the small arrow will expand it into normal size. The chat is a place where players can talk to each other in real time by entering messages and clicking enter to send them to others. There are options of private chat, group, and gang.

![](/img/help/image98.jpg)

## Gameplay

There are 3 main components of gameplay in CrossWars. As a player, you can produce, battle against other players, and participate in heists. Each of those components is a complex time managed part of the game with various parts to take into consideration. The components are also intertwined and there is no one without the other. You can not battle unless you produce units just as you can not participate in the heist if you do not have any drug resources produced.


## 4\. Gangs

CrossWars can be played individually, as a single player with no ties to anyone. It can also be played with cooperation with others in groups that are called gangs. A player does not have to be a part of the gang to be able to play CrossWars but if he or she so chooses, there is no option of being in more than one gang. Once you are in a gang, you can still play as you would if you were not a part of it. You do not lose anything, you only gain. Different gangs have different rules of play and operate in various styles when it comes to wars and alliances with other gangs and there are many benefits a player gets by being a part of the gang. If you are in a gang, you do get a certain level of protection by other gang members in battles and your production of resources and units gets faster by gang buildings so your individual play benefits as well. You can create your own gang or join an existing one that is open to new members. There is currently a limit to how many members a gang can have that is set to 100\. Each gang has 3 different roles for members, boss, capo, and soldier. There is only one gang boss who assigns capo roles to soldiers. The boss upgrades gang buildings and has the final word in everything, capos are above soldiers and below boss in the chain of command while the soldiers are the lowest in the hierarchy. To learn where the gang information is located in the game and read the instructions of creating or joining the gang, click here: GANGS.

## 4.1 Creating a gang

Instructions for creating a gang are located here: Create gang. If you have enough resources, you can start your own gang, name it as you wish and assign a logo to it. CrossWars discord server is at your service and will provide a chat room for your gang where you can talk to other members, discuss strategy and gameplay. This is also the place where you can go into more details when it comes to approving applications of your new potential members. When you create a gang, you become its gang boss and can assign capo roles to your soldiers which will give them more power and authority over your gang. Consider alliances with other gangs and build a strong gang before starting wars with others to assure your victory.

## 4.2 Joining a gang

Instructions for joining a gang are located here: Joining gang. When you are a gang member (boss, capo or soldier) there are many benefits for your individual play. As a single player, you are much stronger if you have a gang to protect your back and you are better at production too. Gang members will usually attack your enemies and your production rates will get higher with higher levels of gang buildings.

If you are currently in a gang and wish to join another, you apply to the new gang. If you are accepted, you will be switched to the new gang upon acceptance. When you join a gang you can’t join another one for 48 hours.

### 4.2.1 Gang buildings

Each Gang building impacts every player in the gang. The higher the building, the bigger your benefits are. Gang members can easily donate their resources to a particular building by inputting the amount and clicking on send resources. Each building has info about its purpose, resources needed for every next level upgrade and the percentage of resources that have already been collected by donations from gang members. Those percentages are also depicted by a pie chart surrounding the resource image where the percentage of received resources is green and the resources missing are yellow. Only gang boss can upgrade the buildings by clicking on upgrade and it can be done only when all 3 resources are at 100%, otherwise, it will say missing resources where the upgrade button is.

#### 4.2.1.1 Gang headquarters

![](/img/help/image96.jpg)

Gang headquarters is your main gang building and it is listed first when you click on buildings. Every other building cannot be higher than the level of your headquarters so when you see “HG upgrade required” where your upgrade button next to some building should be, it means that you first need to upgrade the HQ and then the building you wanted.

#### 4.2.1.2 Embassy

![](/img/help/image39.jpg)

The Embassy allows the Gang to view relations with other Gangs. You can see Gangs you are at war with, allies with and the overall state of relationships.

#### 4.2.1.3 Military Academy

![](/img/help/image33.jpg)

#### 4.2.1.4 Scientific Lab

![](/img/help/image106.jpg)

The scientific lab is the gang building that influences every gang member's individual drug production. With each level, your individual drug production will be higher by 0.25%.

#### 4.2.1.5 Weapon Development Center

![](/img/help/image111.jpg)

Weapon Development Center is the gang building that influences every gang member's individual weapon production. With each level, your individual weapon production will be higher by 0.5%.

#### 4.2.1.6 Distillery School

![](/img/help/image67.jpg)

Deposit page will show you how much of each resource type has every player donated to each building. Buildings are listed with gang member names underneath them and the amount of resources they have donated.

## 4.3 Diplomacy

Every gang has an option to join alliances and wars with other gangs. When you click on Diplomacy you will see every other gang in your main frame with red and green options next to them.

The green button will say OFFER ALLIANCE and the red one will say DECLARE WAR. If you are already at war or have an alliance with a certain gang then those two buttons will be grey with the additional blue one under them that will say STOP. Only the boss and the capos can make those decisions.

## Sharing resources with other players

You can share your resources with other players by transporting drugs, weapons, alcohol or crypto by your units. When you click on MISSIONS in the left menu, you will see TRANSPORT in the menu above the main frame. Click on it to see the transport content of the game.

All of your current units will be listed on the left. You will see a number under each unit that tells you how much of them you have. To transport resources, you first need to select those units you want to carry your resources. Each unit type has a different carry level (you can see the carry levels of every unit in Bootcamp). To select the unit you wish to participate in the transfer, change the number under it and click on the plus size on the image. You can add as many different units as you want but you need to select at least one. For this example, we will select 3 Hobos and 1 Ninja.

Hobo has the carry ability of 10 and Ninja has the carry ability of 150\. Since we have selected 3 hobos, 10 multiplied by 3 is 30 which is added to 150\. We get a total carry of 180 resources. This means that we can transport 180 resources. Those resources can be divided in any way that math allows through the use of integers. You can send all 4 resources, just one or any other combination. For example, it can be 180 drugs or 50 drugs + 30 weapons + 100 alcohol or 10 drugs + 10 weapons + 10 alcohol + 150 crypto or any other mathematically allowed distribution. All you need to do now is enter the name of the player you wish to transport, write a message and click on TRANSPORT. When your units deliver those resources they will come back to you so do not worry about losing them. Once the resources are delivered, your resources will be lesser by the amount that you gave away.

If you are a gang member and click on MY GANG to see all the members, you will see there is a blue TRANSPORT button next to each gang member. When you click on it, it will divert you to transport content that we have covered above.

## 6\. Simulator

You can access the fight simulator by going to https://simulator.drugwars.io/. The left side of the screen is your units and training numbers. The right side is either 1) the opponent unit, training and defense numbers (if you are attacking another player), or 2) the units of the NPC (if you are doing a job).

Clicking the simulator links within the game will often pre-fill values for you. For example, clicking on “Open in the simulator” after you have started a job will automatically fill your units and trainings and also the NPC units.

The simulator is an exact depiction of the game play fight. What it shows is how the fight will resolve.
