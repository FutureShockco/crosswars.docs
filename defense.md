# Defensive Buildings

Defense production provides defensive systems around your base. Each area of production addresses a specific area of defense.

## Cameras

Cameras provide you with information on incoming players to your base.

## Dogs

Dogs attack only one time in the second round. They are powerful against Melee units (as the Security System is for Range units).

## Defense Troops

These troops defend by attacking after the first round and cannot be killed.

## Emergency

The Emergency hospital revives a small percentage of your troops. This is applied once after the fighting has ended.

## Security System

An advanced security system for Range units (as Dogs are for Melee) that attacks in even numbered rounds, starting at round two to round six.

## Hiddden Mines

A first line of defense, using splash damage triggered at the first round only.
