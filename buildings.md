# Main Buildings

Main buildings do not produce anything but are, in a way, the most important ones to have and upgrade on a regular basis. Buildings have unique specialities and are necessary for other gameplay. Some of them are even required for other actions in the game and a player is not able to access the entire game without them. Each office building has the following info presented: name, level that is over the image, cost for upgrade in resources, description, time needed for upgrade with resources and the cost in crypto for instant upgrade.

##### Headquarters

Headquarters is the first building a player should upgrade and the most important building in the game. This building determines the levels of all other buildings which can not be higher than HQ. If a player has HQ level 20 like in the example above, all his other buildings can be upgraded up to level 20\. They can not be upgraded to level 21 until headquarters is upgraded to level 21\. The level of HQ also defines the time necessary for upgrades of other buildings and the higher its level, the shorter that time is.

##### Training Facility

Training facility is the building that allows players to purchase units for battles. If this building is not at level one at least, a player will not be able to purchase units and attack other players. He will also be vulnerable when others battle against him because he will have no units to defend him. Once this building is built, each new level will reduce the time for purchasing units. If a player decides to purchase units with crypto more frequently than with resources, this building can stay at a low level because buying units with crypto is instant and not time managed which means there is no need for upgrading the building to higher levels.

##### Operation Center

Operation center is linked to all resource production buildings. It works in a simple way, all your income in drugs, weapons, and alcohol is raised by 0.5% with each level. Operation center does not influence any of the daily awards, it only raises your daily production of resources. For example, if a player has operation center at level 20, his production will be bigger by 10% because 20 * 0.5 = +10%

##### Pantheon

Pantheon is the only building in CrossWars that influences players' activity outside of the game instead of inside. After each battle, a player has an option to share his wins on social networks or CrossWars forum. If he chooses to share it or the forum, he may get a small reward in return. CrossWars team is upvoting CrossWars battle shares on forum and the higher the Pantheon level, the higher the upvote is. Upvotes are NOT mandatory, a player has a chance to be upvoted but will probably not always have that luck. Higher levels of this building do not increase the chances of an upvote but increase its value if the upvote is given. CrossWars team is also upvoting content that is of high quality and related to the game and other players. Posts that are high in value, interesting and of use to other players have bigger chances of getting upvoted than those of simple battle shares.

##### Research Center

The Research Center is the building necessary for unit training. Besides simple purchasing of units, each player can train his units in various skills available in training. If a player does not have a Research Center on at least level 1, training will not be available. This building determines the level of every training in a way that the maximum level of each training must match the level of the Research Center. If a player, for example, if the Research Center is at level 5, training can only be upgraded up to level 5.
